a) (2 points)

AF → AF (reflexivity)
AF → AF ˄ AF → BDE => AF → ABDEF (accumulation)
AF → ABDEF ˄ F → BCE => AF → ABCDEF (accumulation)
AF → ABCDEF => AF → BCDE (decomposition)

b) (2 points)

Does A → BCDE or F → BCDE hold?

A → BCDE?

A → A (reflexivity)

It doesn't hold (Attribute A doesn't functionally determine BCDE).

F → BCDE?

F → F (reflexivity)
F → F ˄ F → BCE => F → BCEF (accumulation)
F → BCEF ˄ C → D => F → BCDEF (accumulation)
F → BCDEF => F → BCDE (decomposition)

FD holds!

FD is partial, because F → BCDE, where F is a proper subset of AF.
