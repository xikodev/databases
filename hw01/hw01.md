## Task 3

For each teacher who lives in a town with the ZIP code 31500, display teacher's id, first name, last name and the id of
all student groups that this teacher has thaught in the academic year 2024/2025. Display also the data about teachers
who did not teach any of the student groups in the academic year 2024/2025 (if they live in the town with the ZIP code
31500). Those teachers groups mark as NULL.

Keep in mind that a teacher can teach more than one subject to the same group, and the identical tuples **SHOULD NOT**
appear in the result.

Example of the result:

| **teacherid** | **firstname** | **lastname** | **studentgroupid** |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 920           | Ante          | Matas        | D-B1               |
| 946           | Slaven        | Babić        | C-B1               |
| 987           | Antoaneta     | Kalogjera    | D-B5               |
| 987           | Antoaneta     | Kalogjera    | D-B1               |
