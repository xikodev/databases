a) it must be shown TU→UVXYZ (or TU→ TUVWXYZ)

TU → TU (reflexivity):

TU → TU ˄ T → V => TU→ TUV (accumulation)
TU → TUV ˄ TU → XY => TU → TUVXY (accumulation or union)
TU → TUVXY ˄ U → ZW => TU → TUVXYZW (accumulation)

TU → TUVWXYZ => TU → VWXYZ (decomposition) - can do without this step

b) it must be shown that neither T → UVWXYZ nor U → TVWXYZ holds

b1) We will try to prove T → UVWXYZ (or: T → TUVWXYZ)

T → T (refleksivnost):
T → T ˄ T → V => T → TV (accumulation)
The given set of functional dependencies does not allow U to appear on the right-hand side. Therefore, T → TUWXYZ does not hold

b2) We will try to prove U → TVWXYZ (or: U → TUVWXYZ )

U → U (reflexivity)
U → U ˄ U → ZW => U → UZW (accumulation)
Due to the given functional dependencies, it is not possible to continue the accumulation. Therefore, U → TVWXYZ does not hold.

Conclusion: TU functionally determines the remaining attributes of VWXYZ, and neither T nor U alone functionally determines all the remaining attributes. We conclude that TU is a possible key of the relational scheme R.
